Quidam
======

[+amgD] A multilingual play on words descriptive of our current Holy Father, Pope Francis I: Reversing Pope Benedict XVI's "Summorum Pontificum" ('Of the Supreme Pontiffs...,'2007) yields "Pontifex Summorum."  In Latin, Pontifex (nom. sing.) = "Pope," whilst in English-Latin, "Pontiff Ex-," gives the sense of "A Pope, emerges out of--."     Quidam: Pontiffex-Summorum: "Joeblow of the Supreme Pontiffs"
